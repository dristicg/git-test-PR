BOX model
padding me internally change and margine me externally

top right bottom left


flex box
flex-direction row and column 
by default column 

justify content
flex start
flex-end
center
space-between.....will touch margine and have space btw them 
space -evenly...will not touch margine 
space-around



aling -item create  changes in colum justify creat changes in row but if we degine flex-direction then thet will work vice-versa



grid box 



The main difference between inline-grid and grid is that inline-grid makes an element inline, while grid makes it a block-level element
